# Equity Factor Analysis

## Objective

**What is factor analysis? **
Factor trading/investing is an approach that targets specific drivers of return across asset classes. These factors are considered systematic and can be applied broadly across markets, and can be harvested through rule-based strategies. Through research and testing, we look for factors that are applicable and carry statistical significance in the effect of your corresponding thesis. You may think past winners continue to outperform, so you study momentum driven signals, and subsequently long those which have a (+) momentum and short (-) those with negative momentum signals. In trading, these factor signals are often translated into systematic allocation models or multi-factor portfolios. 

### Critical Thinking:

**Persistence & Pervasiveness:**
Many factors work across asset classes, geographies, and time.
Factor premiums are not a fluke but have economic rationale (risk-based or behavioral).
**Risk vs. Behavioral Theories:**
Some factors (e.g., value, size) are explained by traditional risk compensation models.
Others (e.g., momentum) may be due to investor biases (e.g., underreaction, herding) .
**Combining Factors Improves Sharpe Ratios:**
A multi-factor approach can reduce drawdowns and cyclicality.
Factors are not perfectly correlated â€” combining them provides diversification benefits .
**Practical Challenges:**
Real-world implementation faces turnover costs, data mining risks, and changing market regimes.
Factor returns decay over time if they become crowded or arbitraged away.
**Academic vs Practitioner View:**
Academics focus on long-term significance and robustness.
Practitioners focus on real-time performance, scalability, and trading feasibility

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
